# Snake Game in Java

Welcome to the Snake Game project in Java! This classic game was implemented using Java Swing and AWT libraries.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's direction:
- ←: Move left
- →: Move right
- ↑: Move up
- ↓: Move down

The goal of the game is to eat the red apples to grow your snake. Be careful not to run into the walls or into yourself!
